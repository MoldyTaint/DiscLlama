# Ollama Discord Bot

Welcome to the Ollama Discord Bot project! ðŸŽ‰ This bot leverages the Ollama API to bring some cool functionalities to your Discord server. Whether you're here to contribute, learn, or just check it out, we're glad to have you!

**Warning** - I still have no idea what I am doing. I am learning as I go. Expect things to break, expect descriptions to suck however enjoy the ride because I am glad you are here.
